## Description

This project provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms in action. By taking advantage of multithreading, smart pointers, macros, and audio, the visualizer offers an intuitive and engaging way to understand and compare the mechanics and efficiency of different sorting methods.

## Dependencies

* A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later.
* Currently only on Windows.

## Installing

To build the repository after cloning locally, do:
```sh
   sh ./run.sh
```

Then, run `visualizer.exe` inside `build/Release`.

## Future Work
The following features are planned for future updates:

- Provision of sorting statistics.
- Dynamic allocation of sorting size.
- Detailed descriptions for each sorting algorithm.
- Audio feedback.
