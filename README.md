# Sorting Visualizer

>Note: This project is intended for self-learning. If you are an experienced C++ programmer and you wanted to give constructive criticism, please drop an issue.

A simple, interactive, and visually engaging sort visualizer built with ImGui-SFML, ImGui, ImPlot, and C++.

## Description

This project provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms in action. By taking advantage of multithreading, smart pointers, macros, and audio, the visualizer offers an intuitive and engaging way to understand and compare the mechanics and efficiency of different sorting methods.

## Dependencies

* A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later.
* Currently only on Windows.

## Installing
> This visualizer is still in development. I will make a shell script in the future for installing dependencies and linking the project files together.

## Future Work
The following features are planned for future updates:

- Provision of sorting statistics.
- Detailed descriptions for each sorting algorithm.
- Improved audio feedback.
- CMake for managing linkers and generating makefiles.
